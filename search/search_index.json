Tips When constructing new parameters, we follow the following rule: if the command has effect on any file that is not the target, it will have a prefix of the file name. For example, --base-info applies INFO score filtering on the base file, --ld-info perform INFO score filtering on the LD reference file and --info applies the INFO score filtering on the target file. Base File --A1 Column header containing the effective allele . There isn't any standardized label for the effective allele, therefore extra care must be taken to ensure the correct label is provided, otherwise, the effect will be flipped. --A2 Column header containing non-effective allele . --base | -b Base (i.e. GWAS) association file. This is a whitespace delimited file containing association results for SNPs on the base phenotype. This file can be gzipped (must have the .gz suffix). For PRSice to run, the base file must contain the effective allele ( --A1 ), effect size estimates ( --stat ), p-value for association ( --pvalue ), and the SNP ID ( --snp ). --beta This flag is used to indicate if the test statistic is in the form of BETA. If set, PRSice assume the statistic is in the form BETA. Mutually exclusive from --or --bp Column header containing the coordinate of SNPs. When provided, the coordinate of the SNPs will be scrutinized between the base and target file. SNPs with mismatched coordinate will be excluded. --chr Column header containing the chromosome information. When provided, the chromosome information of the SNPs will be scrutinized between the base and target file. SNPs with mismatched chromosome information will be automatically excluded. --index If set, assume the base columns are INDEX instead of the name of the corresponding columns. Index should be 0-based (start counting from 0) --base-info Base INFO score filtering. Format should be Column name , Threshold . SNPs with info score less than Threshold will be ignored. It is useful to perform INFO score filtering to remove SNPs with low imputation confidence score. By default, PRSice will search for the INFO column in your base file and perform info score filtering with threshold of 0.9 . You can disable this behaviour by using --no-default --base-maf Base minor allele frequency (MAF) filtering. Format should be Column name , Threshold . SNPs with MAF less than Threshold will be ignored. Additional column can be provided (e.g. different filtering threshold for case and control), using the following format: Column name , Threshold : Column name , Threshold --no-default Remove all default options. If set, PRSice will not set any defaults. --or This flag is used to indicate if the test statistic is in the form of odd ratios. If set, PRSice assume the statistic is in the form OR. Mutually exclusive from --beta --pvalue | -p Column header containing the p-value. The p-value information must be provided --snp Column header containing the SNP ID. This is required to allow SNP matching between the base and target file. Note While it is possible to implement a feature to allow SNP matching purely based on the chromosome number and coordinate of a variant, the possibiliy of flipping and multi-allelic input complicates the matter. Therefore this feature will not be implemented until an elegant solution can be provided. --stat Column header containing the summary statistic. If --beta is set, default to BETA ; likewise, if --or is set, default to OR . Otherwise, will try and search for OR or BETA from the header of the base file. If both OR and BETA is presented in the header, PRSice will terminate. Target File --binary-target Indicate whether the target phenotype is binary or not. Either T or F should be provided where T represent a binary phenotype. For multiple phenotypes, the input should be separated by comma without space. Default: F if --beta is set and T if --or is set --geno Filter SNPs based on gentype missingness. Must be a value between 0.0 and 1.0 . --info Filter SNPs based on info score. Only used for imputed target data. The INFO score is calculated as the MaCH imputation r-squared value, represented by the following pseudo code: m=Mean of expected genotype v=variance of expected genotype p=m/2 p_a = 2p(1-p) INFO = v/p_a --keep File containing the sample(s) to be extracted from the target file. First column should be FID and the second column should be IID. If --ignore-fid is set, first column should be IID Mutually exclusive from --remove --maf Filter SNPs based on minor allele frequency (MAF). MAF is calculated using only the founder samples Note When perform MAF filtering on dosage data, the MAF is calculated using the hard-coded genotype --nonfounders By default, PRSice will exclude all non-founders from the analysis. When this flag is set, non-founders will be included in the regression model but will still be excluded from LD estimation. --pheno | -f Tab or space delimited phenotype file containing the phenotype(s). First column must be FID of the samples and the second column must be IID of the samples. When --ignore-fid is set, first column must be the IID of the samples. Must contain a header if --pheno-col is specified --pheno-col Headers of phenotypes to be included from the phenotype file. When multiple phenotypes are provided, the phenotype name will be used as part of the file output prefix --prevalence | -k Prevalence of all binary trait. If provided, PRSice will adjust the ascertainment bias of the R2. Note When multiple binary trait is found, prevalence information must be provided for all of them (Either adjust all binary traits, or don't adjust at all). For example, if there are 3 traits A, B and C, where A and C are binary traits with population prevalence of 0.1 and 0.2 respectively. The correct input should be --binary-target T,F,T --prevalence 0.1,0.2 --remove File containing the sample(s) to be removed from the target file. First column should be FID and the second column should be IID. If --ignore-fid is set, first column should be IID Mutually exclusive from --keep --target | -t Target genotype file. Currently support both BGEN and binary PLINK format. For multiple chromosome input, simply substitute the chromosome number with #. PRSice will automatically replace # with 1-22. A separate fam/sample file can be specified by --target prefix , fam or sample file --target-list File containing prefix of target genotype files. Similar to --target but allow for more flexibility. A separate fam/sample file can be specified by --target-list list-file , fam or sample file --type File type of the target file. Support bed (binary plink) and bgen format. Default: bed Dosage --allow-inter Allow the generate of intermediate file. This will speed up PRSice when using dosage data as clumping reference and for hard coding PRS calculation --dose-thres Translate any SNPs with highest genotype probability less than this threshold to missing call. For example, with --dose-thres 0.9 , sample with genotype probability of \\(P(0/0)=0.2\\) , \\(P(0/1)=0.52\\) , \\(P(1/1)=0.28\\) will be set to missing --hard-thres A hardcall is saved when the distance to the nearest hardcall is less than the hardcall threshold. Otherwise a missing code is saved. Default is: 0.1 The distance ( \\(D\\) ) to the nearest hardcall is calculated as: \\[ P(Ref) = 2 \\times P(HomRef) + P(Het) \\\\ P(Alt) = 2 \\times P(HomAlt) + P(Het) \\\\ D = 0.5 \\times \\left(|P\\left(Ref\\right)- round\\left(P\\left(Ref\\right)\\right)| + |P\\left(Alt\\right)- round\\left(P\\left(Alt\\right)\\right)|\\right) \\] Note If dosage data is used as a LD reference, it will always be hard coded to calculate the LD Default: 0.9 --hard When set, will use hard thresholding instead of dosage for PRS construction. Default is to use dosage. Clumping --clump-kb The distance for clumping in kb. For example, if --clump-kb 250 is provided, PRSice will clump any SNPs that is within 250kb to both end of the index SNP (therefore a 500kb window with the index SNP at the center). Now also support distance with a unit. e.g. --clump-kb 1M is a valid input. Default: 1M --clump-r2 The r 2 threshold for clumping. Default: 0.1 --clump-p The p-value threshold use for clumping. Default: 1. --ld | -L LD reference file. Use for estimation of LD during clumping. If not provided, will use the post-filtered target genotype for LD calculation. Support multiple chromosome input. Please see --target for more information. When the target sample is small (e.g. 500) and external panel of the same population is available (e.g. 1000 genome), an external reference panel might be used to improve the LD estimation for clumping. --ld-dose-thres Translate any SNPs with highest genotype probability less than this threshold to missing call. For example, with --ld-dose-thres 0.9 , sample with genotype probability of \\(P(0/0)=0.2\\) , \\(P(0/1)=0.52\\) , \\(P(1/1)=0.28\\) will be set to missing --ld-geno Filter SNPs based on genotype missingness. Must be a value between 0.0 and 1.0 . --ld-info Filter SNPs based on info score. Only used for imputed LD reference. The INFO score is calculated as the MaCH imputation r-squared value, represented by the following pseudo code m=Mean of expected genotype v=variance of expected genotype p=m/2 p_a = 2p(1-p) INFO = v/p_a --ld-hard-thres A hardcall is saved when the distance to the nearest hardcall is less than the hardcall threshold. Otherwise a missing code is saved. Default is: 0.1 The distance ( \\(D\\) ) to the nearest hardcall is calculated as: \\[ P(Ref) = 2 \\times P(HomRef) + P(Het) \\\\ P(Alt) = 2 \\times P(HomAlt) + P(Het) \\\\ D = 0.5 \\times \\left(|P\\left(Ref\\right)- round\\left(P\\left(Ref\\right)\\right)| + |P\\left(Alt\\right)- round\\left(P\\left(Alt\\right)\\right)|\\right) \\] Note If dosage data is used as a LD reference, it will always be hard coded to calculate the LD Default: 0.9 --ld-keep File containing the sample(s) to be extracted from the LD reference file. First column should be FID and the second column should be IID. If --ignore-fid is set, first column should be IID. Mutually exclusive from --ld-remove . No effect if --ld was not provided --ld-list File containing prefix of multiple LD reference files. Similar to --ld but allow more flexibility. A separate fam/sample file can be specified by --ld-list list-file , fam or sample file --ld-maf Filter SNPs based on minor allele frequency (MAF) Note When perform MAF filtering on dosage data, MAF is calculated using the hard-coded genotype --ld-remove File containing the sample(s) to be removed from the LD reference file. First column should be FID and the second column should be IID. If --ignore-fid is set, first column should be IID. Mutually exclusive from --ld-keep --ld-type File type of the LD file. Support bed (binary plink) and bgen format. Default: bed\\n\" --no-clump When set, PRSice will not perform clumping. This is useful a pre-clumped list of SNPs is available. --pearson Use Pearson Correlation instead of maximum likelihood haplotype frequency estimates for LD calculation --proxy Proxy threshold for index SNP to be considered as part of the region represented by the clumped SNP(s). e.g. --proxy 0.8 means the index SNP will represent region of any clumped SNP(s) that has r 2 =0.8 even if the index SNP does not physically locate within the region Covariate --cov | -C Covariate file. First column should be FID and the second column should be IID. If --ignore-fid is set, first column should be IID --cov-col | -c Header of covariates. If not provided, will use all variables in the covariate file. By adding @ in front of the string, any numbers within [ and ] will be parsed. E.g. @PC[1-3] will be read as PC1,PC2,PC3 . Discontinuous input are also supported: @cov[1.3-5] will be parsed as cov1,cov3,cov4,cov5 --cov-factor Header of categorical covariate(s). Dummy variable will be automatically generated. Any items in --cov-factor must also be found in --cov-col Also accept continuous input (start with @ ). P-value Thresholding --bar-levels Level of barchart to be plotted. When --fastscore is set, PRSice will only calculate the PRS for threshold within the bar level. Levels should be comma separated without space --fastscore Only calculate threshold stated in --bar-levels --no-full By default, PRSice will include the full model, i.e. p-value threshold = 1. Setting this flag will disable that behaviour --interval | -i The step size of the threshold. Default: 5e-05 --lower | -l The starting p-value threshold. Default: 5e-08 --model Genetic model use for regression. The genetic encoding is based on the base data where the encoding represent number of the effective allele Available models include: add - Additive model, code as 0/1/2 (default) dom - Dominant model, code as 0/1/1 rec - Recessive model, code as 0/0/1 het - Heterozygous only model, code as 0/1/0 --missing Method to handle missing genotypes. Available methods include: - MEAN_IMPUTE - Missing genotypes contribute an amount proportional to imputed allele frequency (default) - SET_ZERO - To throw out missing observations instead - CENTER - shift all scores to mean zero. --no-regress Do not perform the regression analysis and simply output all PRS. --score Method to calculate the polygenic score. Available methods include: avg - Take the average effect size (default) std - Standardize the effect size sum - Direct summation of the effect size --upper | -u The final p-value threshold. Default: 0.5 PRSet --background String to indicate a background file. This string should have the format of Name:Type where type can be bed - 0-based range with 3 column. Chr Start End range - 1-based range with 3 column. Chr Start End gene - A file contain a column of gene name As the name suggest, the background file inform PRSet of the background signal to be used for competitive p-value calculation. When a background file is not provided, PRSet will construct the background using the GTF file. However, if both the background and the GTF file isn't provided, PRSet cannot perform the set base permutation. In this case, you can use --full-back to indicate that you'd like to use the whole genome as the background set --bed | -B Bed file containing the selected regions. Name of bed file will be used as the region identifier. Warning Bed file is 0-based. --feature Feature(s) to be included from the gtf file. Default: exon,CDS,gene,protein_coding --full-back Use the whole genome as background set for competitive p-value calculation --gtf | -g GTF file containing gene boundaries. Required when --msigdb is used Tip Human Genome build GRCh38 can be downloaded from here . --msigdb | -m MSigDB file containing the pathway information. Require the gtf file. The GMT file format used by MSigDB is a simple tab/space delimited text file where each line correspond to a single gene set following by Gene IDs: [ Set A ] [ Gene 1 ] [ Gene 2 ] ... [ Set B ] [ Gene 1 ] [ Gene 2 ] ... Tip Curated MSigDB files can be downloaded from here after registration in here --set-perm The number of set base permutation to perform. This is only used for calculating the competitive p-value. 10,000 permutation nshould generally be enough. --snp-set Provide gene sets using SNP ID. Two different format is allowed: SNP Set list format: A file containing a single column of SNP ID. Name of the set will be the file name or can be provided using --snp-set File:Name MSigDB format: Each row represent a single SNP set with the first column containing the name of the SNP set. --wind-3 Add N base(s) to the 3' region of each gene regions. Unit suffix are allowed e.g. --wind-3 1M --wind-5 Add N base(s) to the 5' region of each gene regions. Unit suffix are allowed e.g. --wind-5 1M R specific commands --prsice Location of the PRSice executable. --dir Location to install require R packages. Only require if the required packages are not installed. We require the following packages: optparse , method , tools , ggplot2 , data.table , grDevices , RColorBrewer Plotting --bar-col-high Colour of the most predicting threshold. Default: firebrick --bar-col-low Colour of the poorest predicting threshold. Default: dodgerblue --bar-col-p When set, will change the colour of bar to p-value threshold instead of the p-value from the association with phenotype --bar-palatte Colour palatte to be used for bar plotting when --bar_col_p is set. Default: YlOrRd --device Select different plotting devices. You can choose any plotting devices supported by base R. Default: png --multi-plot Plot the top N target phenotypes / gene sets in a summary plot --plot When set, will only perform plotting using existing PRSice result files. All other parameters are still required such that PRSice can correctly locate the required input files for plotting. --plot-set The default behaviour of PRSet is to plot the bar-chart, high-resolution plot and quantile plot of the \"Base\" gene set, which consider all SNPs within the genome. By using the --plot-set option, you can plot the specific set of interest. --quantile | -q Number of quantiles to plot. No quantile plot will be generated when this is not provided. --quant-break Parameter to indicate an uneven distribution of quantile. Values represent the upperbound of each quantile group. e.g. With --quantile 10 --quant-break 1,5,10 , the quantiles will be grouped into \\(0\\lt Q \\le 1\\) , \\(1\\lt Q \\le 5\\) , \\(5\\lt Q \\le 10\\) Note To use --quant-break , you must set the correct amount of quantiles. For example, if the largest value in --quant-break is 100, then you must use --quantile 100 --quant-extract | -e File containing sample ID to be plot on a separated quantile e.g. extra quantile containing only schizophrenia samples. Must contain IID. Should contain FID if --ignore-fid isn't set. Note This will only work if the base and target has a different phenotype or if the target phenotype is quantitative --quant-ref Reference quantile for quantile plot. Default is number of quantiles divided by 2 Or in the event where --quant-break is used, represent the upper bound of the reference quantile --scatter-r2 When set, will change the y-axis of the high resolution scatter plot to R2 instead Miscellaneous --all-score Output PRS for ALL threshold. Warning This will generate a huge file --exclude File contains SNPs to be excluded from the analysis. Mutually exclusive from --extract --extract File contains SNPs to be included in the analysis. Mutually exclusive from --exclude --id-delim Delimiter used to concatinate FID and IID when performing ID matching. Especially useful for BGEN file processing --ignore-fid Ignore FID for all input. When this is set, first column of all file will be assume to be IID instead of FID --keep-ambig Keep ambiguous SNPs. Only use this option whe base and target has the same A1 and A2 alleles --logit-perm When performing permutation on binary phenotypes, use logistic regression instead of linear regression. This will substantially slow down PRSice. Note One problem with using --logit-perm is that some of the permuted phenotype might be suffer from perfect separation. This leads to the GLM logistic model not being able to be converge (thus terminating PRSice). If you encounter such problem, you might want to exclude the --logit-perm option. In most case, the p-value of the linear model should be similar to the logistic model --memory Maximum memory usage allowed. PRSice will try its best to honor this setting. For example, --memory 10Gb will restrict PRSice to use no more than 10Gb of memory. However, as we are not using memory pool like PLINK, it is possible for PRSice to use more than the allowed amount. PRSice will mainly check the memory usage when: Perform Clumping Perform permutation analysis Perform set-based permutation --non-cumulate Calculate non-cumulative PRS. PRS will be reset to 0 for each new P-value threshold instead ofadding up --out | -o Prefix for all file output. Note If multiple target phenotypes are included (e.g. using --pheno-col ), the phenotype will be appended to the output prefix If multiple gene set are included, the name of the set will be appended to the output prefix (after the phenotype (if any)) --perm Number of permutation to perform. This will generate the empirical p-value. Recommend to use value larger than or equal to 10,000 Note When permutation is required, PRSice will perform the following operation Perform normal PRSice across all thresholds and obtain p-value of the most significant threshold Repeat PRSice analysis N times with permuted phenotype. Count the number of time where the p-value of the most significant threshold for the permuted --print-snp Print all SNPs that remains in the analysis after clumping is performed. For PRSet, Y indicate the SNPs falls within the gene set of interest and N otherwise. If only PRSice is performed, a single \"gene set\" called \"Base\" will be indicated with all entries marked as Y --seed | -s Seed used for permutation. If not provided, system time will be used as seed. This will allow the same results to be generated when the same seed and input is used --thread | -n Number of thread use Tip Maximum number of thread can be specified by using --thread max Note PRSice will limit the maximum number of thread used to the number of core available on the system as detected by PRSice. --x-range Range of SNPs to be excluded from the whole analysis. It can either be a single bed file or a comma seperated list of range.

There are a few methods to account for the overfitting: Evaluate performance in an independent validation sample Cross validation Calculate an empirical P-value In, PRSice-2, we have implemented a permutation analysis to calculate an empirical P-value. Permutation Procedure To calculate the empirical P-value, PRSice-2 perform the following Perform standard PRSice analysis Obtain the p-value of association of the best p-value threshold ( \\(P_o\\) ) Randomly shuffle the phenotype and repeat the PRSice analysis Obtain the p-value of association of the best p-value threshold under the null ( \\(P_{null}\\) ) Repeat step-2 \\(N=10,000\\) times (for --perm 10000 ) The empirical p-value can then be calculated as \\[ \\text{Empirical-}P = \\frac{\\sum_{n=1}^NI(P_{null}\\lt P_o)+1}{N+1} \\] where \\(I(.)\\) is the indicator function. Warning While the empirical p-value for association will be controlled for Type 1 error, the observed phenotypic variance explained, R 2 , remains unadjusted and is affected by overfitting. Therefore, it is imperative to perform out-of-samp,le prediction, or cross-validation to evaluate the predictive accuracy of PRS. Computation Algorithm In reality, due to the time consuming nature of permutation analysis, PRSice-2 exploit certain property of random number generation to speed up the permutation analysis. To generate random numbers, a random seed is required. When the same seed is provided, the same sequence of random number will always be generated. PRSice-2 exploit this property, such that the permutation analysis is performed as follow Generate the random seed or use the user provided random seed to \\(S\\) For each p-value threshold Calculate the observed p-value Seed the random number generator with \\(S\\) For Quantitative trait, (and binary trait, unless --logit-perm is set), decompose the matrix of the independent variables ( \\(Intercept+PRS+Covariates\\) ) Generate N copies of random phenotypes via random shuffling.

After registration in here , you can download different gene sets curated by the Broad Institute. Alternatively, you can also generate your own gene sets in the GMT format: [Set A] [Gene 1] [Gene 2] ... [Set B] [Gene 1] [Gene 2] ... Sometimes, the MSigDB file might store the URL for the gene set on the second column [Set A] [url for set A] [Gene 1] [Gene 2] ... And PRSet can properly handle that. Gene GTF As MSigDB file does not contain the genome boundary of the genes within the gene set, one must also provide a GTF file. A GTF file contains the genome boundary of the genetic elements within the human genome and PRSet can use the information from GTF to determine if a SNP falls within a specific gene. One can download the GTF file file Human (Genome build GTCh38.p7) here . PRSet will look for any regions with feature of exon , gene , protein_coding or CDS ( case sensitive ). Any genomic regions without these features will be ignored. Alternatively, you can specify the features using the --feature command. Note For those who are unfamiliar, different version of the genome might differ slightly in their coordinates. Therefore it is vital to ensure all the files are originated from the same genome build Bed Files In addition, PRSet also accept bed file(s) as an input. Important A bed file must contain a minimum of 3 columns: chrom - The name of the chromosome (e.g. chr3, chrY, chr2_random) or scaffold (e.g. scaffold10671). chromStart - The starting position of the feature in the chromosome or scaffold. The first base in a chromosome is numbered 0. chromEnd - The ending position of the feature in the chromosome or scaffold. The chromEnd base is not included in the display of the feature. For example, the first 100 bases of a chromosome are defined as chromStart=0, chromEnd=100, and span the bases numbered 0-99. PRSet will read in any number of bed files (comma separated) and use the file names as the name of the gene set. Note An annoying feature of bed file is that it starts with 0 whereas for example, the plink formats starts the coordinates at 1. So do remember to -1 from the region start when you build your own bed file from scratch. Clumping in PRSet In PRSice-2, clumping is performed to account for linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs. However, when performing set based analysis, special care are required to perform clumping. Take the following as an example: Assume that: Light Blue fragments are the intergenic regions Dark Blue fragments are the genic regions Red fragments are the gene set regions SNPs are represented as thunder bolt, with the \"index\" SNP in clumping denoted by the green thunderbolt If we simply perform a genome wide clumping, we might remove all SNPs residing within the gene set of interest, reducing the signal: Therefore, to maximize signal within each gene set, we must perform clumping for each gene sets separately: this can be a tedious process and are prone to error. To speed up clumping, PRSice-2 adopt a \" capture the flag \" system. Each SNPs contains a flag to represent their gene set membership. If a SNP is a member for the set, it will have a flag of 1, otherwise it will have a flag of 0. For example: SNP Set A Set B Set C Set D SNP 1 1 0 1 1 SNP 2 0 0 1 1 SNP 3 1 1 0 1 If we use SNP 1 as the index SNP, then after clumping, we will have SNP Set A Set B Set C Set D SNP 1 1 0 1 1 SNP 2 0 0 0 0 SNP 3 0 1 0 0 which removes SNP 2, but will retain SNP 3. This allow us to achieve set based clumping by only performing a single pass genome wide clumping. P-value Threshold and Proxy Clumping Options Proxy PRSet One complication in PRSet is the definition of SNP membership. The default option of PRSet is to only include SNPs that are physically within the target region. However, it is also likely for SNPs outside the region to influence functions of the set. Therefore we provide the --proxy option. Essentially, this provide a soft cutoff to SNP membership. For example, when user define --proxy 0.8 , if LD between SNP A and SNP B is more than 0.8, then SNP A will be considered to be within the same regions as SNP B and vice versa. P-value thresholding By default, PRSet do not perform p-value thresholding and will simply calculate the set based PRS at P-value threshold of 1. This is because it is unclear whether the set is associated with the phenotype when the best-threshold contained only a small portion of SNPs within the gene sets. If you wish to perform p-value thresholding with PRSet, you will need to specify any of the parameters related to p-value thresholding, i.e. --interval , --lower , --upper , --fastscore or --bar-levels . Competitive P-value Calculation A challenge in Set base analysis is to obtain a competitive p-value, which indicates the level of enrichment, as opposed to the self-contained p-value which indicates the level of association. To obtain a competitive p-value, PRSet can perform a permutation analysis as follow Allocate SNPs to each gene sets Allocate SNPs to a background gene set if --full-back is specified, use the whole genome as the background if a background file is provided via the --background command, it will be used to construct the background set otherwise, will try to use the GTF file provided from --gtf command as the background (with feature filtering w.r.t --feature ) Perform set based clumping on all sets (including the background set) Obtain the p-value of association for the best threshold for each sets ( \\(P_{observed}\\) ) While PRSet allow one to perform p-value thresholding on the set scores, we recommend against it as it is difficult to interpret the result. Using an extreme example, if only one SNP is included in the best threshold for a set, should we really consider this single SNP as representative of the gene set? For each gene set with \\(N\\) post-clump SNPs Randomly select \\(N\\) post-clump SNPs from the background set and construct a null PRS Calculate the p-value of association of the null PRS to obtain a null P-value ( \\(P_{null}\\) ) Repeat 1-2 \\(M\\) times, where \\(M\\) can be set via --set-perm The competitive P-value is calculated as $$ \\text{Competitive-}P = \\frac{\\sum_{n=1}^NI(P_{null}\\lt P_observed)+1}{N+1} $$ where \\(I(.)\\) is the indicator function. Output Data PRS model-fit A file containing the PRS model fit across thresholds is named [Name].prsice , where [Name] is the output prefix name as specified by --out this is stored as Name of Set, Threshold, R2, P-value, Coefficient, Standard Error, and Number of SNPs at this threshold Scores for each individual A file containing PRS for each individual at the best-fit PRS named [Name].best is provide. This file has the format of: FID,IID, In Regression, PRS at best threshold for Set 1, PRS at best threshold for Set 2, ... Where the has phenotype column indicate whether the sample contain all the required phenotype for PRSice analysis (e.g. Samples with missing phenotype/covariate will not be included in the regression. These samples will be indicated as \"No\" under the in regression column) If --all option is used, a file named [Name].all.score is also generated Please note, if --all options is used, the PRS for each individual at all threshold will be given. In the event where the target sample size is large and a lot of threshold are tested, this file can be large. This is especially true when large number of gene sets were provided. Note PRSice also supports multiple phenotypes for target data. All output prefix will change to [Name].[Pheno] where [Pheno] is the name of the phenotype.

PRSice has no problem reading in a gzipped base file. PLINK output is used, then please make sure there is a column for the effective allele (A1) and specify it with --A1 option. On the other hand, if the base data follows other formats, then the column headers can be provided using the --chr , --A1 , --A2 , --stat , --snp , --bp , --se , --pvalue options Important PRSice requires the base file to contain information of the effective allele (--A1), effect size estimates (--stat), p-value for association (--pvalue), and the SNP ID (--snp). If the input file does not contain a column header, the column can be specified using their index (start counting from 0) with the --index flag. For example, with the following input format: SNP CHR BP A1 A2 OR SE P rs3094315 1 752566 A G 0.9912 0.0229 0.7009 rs3131972 1 752721 A G 1.007 0.0228 0.769 rs3131971 1 752894 T C 1.003 0.0232 0.8962 the parameters can either be --snp SNP --chr CHR --bp BP --A1 A1 --A2 A2 --stat OR --se SE --pvalue P or --snp 0 --chr 1 --bp 2 --A1 3 --A2 4 --stat 5 --se 6 --pvalue 7 --index Strand flips are automatically detected and accounted for. If an imputation info score or the minor allele frequencies (MAF) are also included in the file, --info-base Info Name , Info Threshold and --maf-base MAF Name , MAF Threshold can be used to filter SNPs based on their INFO score and MAF respectively. For binary trait base file, SNPs can be filtered according to the MAF in case and control separately using --maf-base Name for Control , Threshold for Control : Name for Case , Threshold for Case By default, PRSice will look for the following column names automatically from the base file header if --index was not provided: CHR, BP, A1, A2, SNP, P, INFO, SE (case sensitive) and OR / BETA (case insensitive) --no-default can be used to disable all the defaults of PRSice. Note PRSice will ignore any columns that were not found in the base file (e.g. If --A2 B is specified but none of the column header is B , then PRSice will treat it as if no A2 information is presented) Target Dataset Currently two different target file format is supported by PRSice: PLINK Binary A target dataset in PLINK binary format must consist of three files: .bed , .bim , and a .fam file - where bed contains the compressed genotype data, bim contains the SNP information and fam contains the family information. Currently only SNP major PLINK format are supported (default output of the latest PLINK program). The .bed and .bim file must have the same prefix. If the .fam file follow a different prefix from the .bed and bim file, it can be specified using --target bim bed prefix , fam file Warning The fam file MUST contains the correct number of samples or PRSice will crash Note -9 will NOT be considered as missing for quantitative traits If the binary file is separated into individual chromosomes, then an # can be used to specify the location of the chromosome number in the file name. PRSice will automatically substitute # with 1-22 i.e. If the files are chr1. ,chr2. ,...,chr22. , just use --target chr# Note Chromosome number substitution will not be performed on the external fam file as the fam file should be the same for all chromosomes. Alternatively, if your PLINK files do not have a unified prefix, you can use --target-list to provide a file containing all prefix to PRSice. BGEN PRSice currently support BGEN v1.1 and v1.2. To specify a BGEN file, simply add the --type bgen or --ld-type bgen to the PRSice command As BGEN does not store the phenotype information and sometime not even the sample ID, you must provide a phenotype file ( --pheno-file ) for PRSice to run. Alternatively, the sample file can be provided using Note The sample file is required even if --no-regress is set as the sample ID is required for output. This requirement might be losen in future versions With BGEN input, a number of PRSice options become effective: --hard : Normally, with BGEN format, PRS is calculated using the dosage information. But hard-thresholding can be performed by using the --hard option. SNPs will then coded as the genotype (0,1 or 2) with probability larger than threshold specified by --hard-thres . If no such genotype is presented, the SNP will be coded as missing --hard-thres : The genotype probability threshold. SNPs with no genotype having a probability larger than this threshold will be treated as missing To perform clumping on BGEN file, we need to repeatly decompress the genotype dosage and convert them into PLINK binary format. Therefore, to speed up the clumping process, you can allow PRSice to generate a large intermediate file, containing the hard coded genotypes in PLINK binary format by using the --allow-inter option. Phenotype files An external phenotype file can be provided to PRSice using the --pheno-file parameter. This must be a tab / space delimited file and missing data must be represented by either NA or -9 (only for binary traits). The first two column of the phenotype file should be the FID and the IID, or when --ignore-fid is set, the first column should be the IID. The rest of the columns can be the phenotype(s). To specify a trait within the phenotype file, the column name for the trait can be specified using --pheno-col , providing that the phenotype file contains a header. Multiple column name can be provided via a comma separated list: e.g. --pheno-col A,B,C,D . Trait(s) not found within the phenotype file will be automatically skipped. Important The column name(s) should not contain space nor comma Note When more than one traits are provided, the column name will be appended to the output prefix. LD reference When the target sample is small (e.g. 500 samples), an external reference panel can be used to improve the LD estimation for clumping. The LD reference follows the same notion as the target dataset. Simply use --ld LD refernce to specify your LD reference panel file and --ld-type to specify the format When a LD reference file is not provided and --no-clump is not specified, the target file will be used as the LD reference panel Important Any parameters with the --ld prefix will only work on the file specified by the --ld parameter. That is, if a LD reference file is not provided, none of the --ld-* options will be used. If a different set of filtering is to be perforemd on the target file when performing LD calculation, it must be provided separately to the --ld parameter e.g. --target target --ld target --keep samples for PRS --ld-keep samples for LD Note BGEN file will always be hard coded when used to estimate the LD Clumping By default, PRSice will perform Clumping to remove SNPs that are in LD with each other. Similar to PLINK, the r 2 values computed by PRSice are based on maximum likelihood haplotype frequency estimates. The pearson correlation r 2 calculation is also supported and can be specified by using --pearson . Both cases and controls are included in the LD calculation. Alternatively, a combination of --ld and --ld-keep / -ld-remove can be used to restrict LD calculation in control samples. Clumping parameters can be changed by using the --clump-kb , --clump-r2 and --clump-p option. Clumping can be disabled using --no-clump PRS calculation PRSice allow different genetic models to be specified (e.g. add, dom, het, rec), and the polygenic score of each of those are calculated differently Assuming \\(S\\) is the summary statistic for the effective allele and \\(G\\) is the number of the effective allele observed, then the main difference between the models is how the genotypes are coded: For additive model (add) \\[ G = G \\] For dominant model (with respect to the effective allele of the base file) \\[ G = \\begin{cases} 0 \\text{if $G$ = 0} \\\\ 1 \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] For recessive model (with respect to the effective allele of the base file) \\[ G = \\begin{cases} 1 \\text{if $G$ = 2} \\\\ 0 \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] For heterozygous model \\[ G = \\begin{cases} 1 \\text{if $G$ = 1} \\\\ 0 \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] Then depending on the --score option, the PRS is calculated as (assuming \\(M_j\\) is the number of Alleles included in the PRS of the \\(j^{th}\\) individual) --score avg (default): $$ PRS_j = \\sum_i{\\frac{S_i\\times G_{ij}}{M_j}} $$ --score sum : $$ PRS_j = \\sum_i{S_i\\times G_{ij}} $$ --score std : $$ PRS_j = \\frac{\\sum_i({S_i\\times G_{ij}}) - \\text{Mean}(PRS)}{\\text{SD}(PRS)} $$ Sometimes, sample can have missing genotype. The --missing option is used to determine how PRSice handle the missingness. When not specified, the Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) in the target sample will be used as the genotype as the sample with missing genotype. If --missing NO_MEAN_IMPUTATION is set, the SNP for the missing samples will be excluded. Alternatively, if --missing CENTER is set, all PRS calculated will be minused by the MAF of the SNP (therefore, missing samples will have PRS of 0). Empirical P-value calculation All approaches to PRS calculation involve parameter optimisation in generating the final prediction model, and are thus vulnerable to overfitting. There are a few methods to account for the overfitting: Evaluate performance in an independent validation sample Cross validation Calculate an empirical P-value In, PRSice-2, we have implemented a permutation analysis to calculate an empirical P-value. Permutation Procedure To calculate the empirical P-value, PRSice-2 perform the following Perform standard PRSice analysis Obtain the p-value of association of the best p-value threshold ( \\(P_o\\) ) Randomly shuffle the phenotype and repeat the PRSice analysis Obtain the p-value of association of the best p-value threshold under the null ( \\(P_{null}\\) ) Repeat step-2 \\(N=10,000\\) times (for --perm 10000 ) The empirical p-value can then be calculated as \\[ \\text{Empirical-}P = \\frac{\\sum_{n=1}^NI(P_{null}\\lt P_o)+1}{N+1} \\] where \\(I(.)\\) is the indicator function. Warning While the empirical p-value for association will be controlled for Type 1 error, the observed phenotypic variance explained, R 2 , remains unadjusted and is affected by overfitting. Therefore, it is imperative to perform out-of-samp,le prediction, or cross-validation to evaluate the predictive accuracy of PRS. Computation Algorithm In reality, due to the time consuming nature of permutation analysis, PRSice-2 exploit certain property of random number generation to speed up the permutation analysis. To generate random numbers, a random seed is required. When the same seed is provided, the same sequence of random number will always be generated. PRSice-2 exploit this property, such that the permutation analysis is performed as follow Generate the random seed or use the user provided random seed to \\(S\\) For each p-value threshold Calculate the observed p-value Seed the random number generator with \\(S\\) For Quantitative trait, (and binary trait, unless --logit-perm is set), decompose the matrix of the independent variables ( \\(Intercept+PRS+Covariates\\) ) Generate N copies of random phenotypes via random shuffling. Calculate the p-value association for each null phenotype For each permutation, check if the current null p-value is the most significant. Replace the previous \"best\" p-value if the current null p-value is more significant Calculate the empirical p-value once all p-value thresholds have been processed As we re-seed the random number generator for each p-value threshold, we ensure the random phenotypes generated in each p-value thresholds to be identical, therefore allowing us to reuse the calculated PRS, and also reuse the decomosed matrix, which leads to significant speed up of the permutation process. Output of Results Bar Plot Note Hereon, [Name] is assumed to be the output prefix specified using --out and [date] is the date when the analysis was performed. PRSice will always generate a bar plot displaying the model fit of the PRS at P-value threshold as indicated by --bar-levels The plot will be named as [Name]_BARPLOT_[date].png . An example bar plot: High Resolution Plot If --fastscore is not specified, a high-resolution plot named [Name]_HIGH-RES_PLOT_[date].png will be generated. This plot present the model fit of PRS calculated at all P-value thresholds. Important The model fit is defined as the \\(R^2\\) of the Full model - the \\(R^2\\) of the Null model For example, if Sex is a covariate in the PRSice calculation, then model fit = \\(R^2\\) of \\(Pheno\\sim PRS+Sex\\) - \\(R^2\\) of \\(Pheno\\sim Sex\\) A green line connects points showing the model fit at the broad P-value thresholds used in the corresponding bar plot are also added. An example high-resolution plot: Quantile Plots If --quantile [number of quantile] is specified, a quantile plot named [Name]_QUANTILE_PLOT_[date].png will be generated. The quantile plot provide an illustration of the effect of increasing PRS on predicted risk of phenotype. An example quantile plot: Specifically, the quantile plot is generated by the following steps Regress out the covariate from the phenotype (if any) and use the standardized residual to represent the phenotype Distribute samples into user specified number of quantiles Treat the quantiles as a factor, where the --quant-ref is the base factor Perform regression with \\(Pheno \\sim Quantile\\) Set the reference quantile to have coefficient of 1 (if binary) or 0 (otherwise) The point of each quantile is their OR (if binary) or coefficient (otherwise) from the regression analysis A text file [Name]_QUANTILE\\_[date].txt is also produced, which provides all the data used for the plotting. Moreover, uneven distribution of quantiles can be specified using the --quant-break function, which will generate the strata plot. For example, to replicate the quantile break from Natarajan et al (2015): Percentile of PRS, % All studies in iCOGS excluding pKARMA OR (95% CI) pKARMA only OR (95% CI) 1 0.29 (0.23 to 0.37) 0.48 (0.28 to 0.83) 1\u20135 0.42 (0.37 to 0.47) 0.48 (0.36 to 0.63) 5\u201310 0.55 (0.50 to 0.61) 0.58 (0.45 to 0.74) 10\u201320 0.65 (0.60 to 0.70) 0.68 (0.57 to 0.81) 20\u201340 0.80 (0.76 to 0.85) 0.81 (0.71 to 0.94) 40\u201360 1 (referent) 1 (referent) 60\u201380 1.18 (1.12 to 1.24) 1.35 (1.19 to 1.54) 80\u201390 1.48 (1.39 to 1.57) 1.56 (1.34 to 1.82) 90\u201395 1.69 (1.56 to 1.82) 2.05 (1.70 to 2.47) 95\u201399 2.20 (2.03 to 2.38) 2.12 (1.73 to 2.59) 99 2.81 (2.43 to 3.24) 3.06 (2.16 to 4.34) The following command can be added to PRSice command: --quantile 100 \\ --quant-break 1,5,10,20,40,60,80,90,95,99,100 \\ --quant-ref 60 Specifically, --quant-break indicates the upper bound of each group and --quant-ref specify the upper bound of the reference quantiles Note The quantile boundaries are non-overlapping, with the inclusive upper bound and exclusive lower bound PRS model-fit A file containing the PRS model fit across thresholds is named [Name].prsice ; this is stored as Set, Threshold, \\(R^2\\) , P-value, Coefficient, Standard Deviation and Number of SNPs at this threshold Important \\(R^2\\) reported in the prsice file is the \\(R^2\\) of the Full model - the \\(R^2\\) of the Null model Scores for each individual A file containing PRS for each individual at the best-fit PRS named [Name].best is provide. This file has the format of: FID,IID,In_Regression, PRS at best threshold of first set, PRS at best threshold of second set, ... Where the In_Regression column indicate whether the sample is included in the regression model performed by PRSice. If --all-score option is used, a file named [Name].all.score is also generated This file has the format of FID, IID, PRS for first set at first threshold, PRS for first set at second threshold, ... If --all-score is used, the PRS for each individual at all threshold and all sets will be given. In the event where the target sample size is large and a lot of threshold are tested, this file can be large. Summary Information Information of the best model fit of each phenotype and gene set is stored in [Name].summary . The summary file contain the following fields: Phenotype - Name of Phenotype Set - Name of Gene Set Threshold - Best P-value Threshold PRS.R2 - Variance explained by the PRS. If prevalence is provided, this will be adjusted for ascertainment Full.R2 - Variance explained by the full model (including the covariates).

Calculate the p-value association for each null phenotype For each permutation, check if the current null p-value is the most significant. Replace the previous \"best\" p-value if the current null p-value is more significant Calculate the empirical p-value once all p-value thresholds have been processed As we re-seed the random number generator for each p-value threshold, we ensure the random phenotypes generated in each p-value thresholds to be identical, therefore allowing us to reuse the calculated PRS, and also reuse the decomosed matrix, which leads to significant speed up of the permutation process.","title":"Computation Algorithm"},{"location":"step_by_step/#output-of-results","text":"","title":"Output of Results"},{"location":"step_by_step/#bar-plot","text":"Note Hereon, [Name] is assumed to be the output prefix specified using --out and [date] is the date when the analysis was performed.
