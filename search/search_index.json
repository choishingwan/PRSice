Currently only SNP major PLINK format are supported  (default output of the latest PLINK program).\n\n\nThe \n.bed\n and \n.bim\n file must have the same prefix.\n\n\nIf the \n.fam\n file follow a different prefix from the \n.bed\n and \nbim\n file, it can be specified using\n\n\n--target \nbim bed prefix\n,\nfam file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThe fam file MUST contains the correct number of samples or PRSice will crash\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n-9 will NOT be considered as missing for quantitative traits\n\n\n\n\nIf the binary file is separated into individual chromosomes, then an # can be used to specify the location of the chromosome number in the file name.\nPRSice will automatically substitute # with 1-22\n\n\ni.e. If tje files are chr1.\n,chr2.\n,...,chr22.\n, just use\n\n\n--target chr#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nChromosome number substitution will not be performed on the external fam file as the fam file should be the same for all chromosomes. \n\n\n\n\nBGEN\n\n\nPRSice currently support BGEN v1.1 and v1.2. To specify a BGEN file, simply add the \n--type bgen\n or \n--ld-type bgen\n to the PRSice command\n\n\nAs BGEN does not store the phenotype information and sometime not even the sample ID, you \nmust\n provide\na phenotype file (\n--pheno-file\n) for PRSice to run. Alternatively, the sample file can be provided using\n\n\n--target \nbgen prefix\n,\nsample file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe sample file is required even if \n--no-regress\n is set as the sample ID is required for output. This requirement might be losen in future versions\n\n\n\n\nWith BGEN input, a number of PRSice options become effective:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--hard\n: Normally, with BGEN format, PRS is calculated using the dosage information.\nBut hard-thresholding can be performed by using the \n--hard\n option. SNPs will then coded as the genotype (0,1 or 2) with\nprobability larger than threshold specified by \n--hard-thres\n. If no such genotype is presented, the SNP will be\ncoded as missing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--hard-thres\n: The genotype probability threshold. SNPs with no genotype having a probability larger than this\nthreshold will be treated as missing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhenotype files\n\n\nAn external phenotype file can be provided to PRSice using the \n--pheno-file\n\nparameter.\nThe first two column of the phenotype file should be the FID and the IID, or when\n\n--ignore-fid\n is set, the first column should be the IID.\nThe rest of the columns can be the phenotype(s).\n\n\nTo specify a trait within the phenotype file, the column name for the trait can be specified using\n\n--pheno-col\n, providing that the phenotype file contains a header.\nMultiple column name can be provided via a comma separated\nlist: e.g. \n--pheno-col A,B,C,D\n. Trait(s) not found within the phenotype file will\nbe automatically skipped.\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nThe column name(s) should not contain \nspace\n nor \ncomma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWhen more than one traits are provided, the column name will be appended to\nthe output prefix.\n\n\n\n\nLD reference\n\n\nWhen the target sample is small (e.g. \n 500 samples), an external reference panel can be used\nto improve the LD estimation for clumping.\n\n\nThe LD reference follows the same notion as the target dataset.
